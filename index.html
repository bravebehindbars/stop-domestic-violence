                        <h2 class="fs-4 fw-bold">What are the Effects of Domestic Violence on its victims and their loved ones? </h2>
                        <p class="mb-0">Domestic violence is associated with a range of physical and mental health effects. Being a victim of domestic violence is linked to increased risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and suicide. Exposure to traumatic events can lead to stress, fear and isolation, which may lead to depression and suicidal thoughts or behavior.Survivors of domestic violence may internalize verbal abuse from their partner. They may blame themselves for their situation or feel anger and resentment toward themselves. After enduring abuse, survivors may experience difficulties in new relationships.Domestic violence survivors are more likely to experience health problems and perceive their overall health as poor compared to those who have not experienced domestic violence. About 75% of female survivors experience some form of injury related to the domestic violence. In addition to injuries, common physical symptoms include headaches, insomnia, chronic pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, chest, back, and pelvic pain.Traumatic brain injury and nonfatal strangulation such as choking are forms of intimate partner violence that often go unrecognized. Intimate partner violence can also result in unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy complications for the mother and child.Additionally, more than half of female homicide victims in the U.S. are killed by a current or former male intimate partner, according to U.S. crime reports.

                        <h2 class="fs-4 fw-bold">What are causes of Domestic Violence?</h2>
                        <p class="mb-0">It is important to remember that domestic violence is a choice and not an uncontrolled impulse. A person's actions cannot cause abusive behavior.If you are experiencing domestic violence, you are never to blame. You cannot “make” someone abuse you, no matter what an abuser may say. Even if you could do everything possible to please an abusive partner, their need to control you will likely still show itself through their behavior eventually. Children who witness domestic abuse may grow up thinking physical or psychological violence are acceptable ways to solve conflict. In the same way, raising children to believe a different gender is inferior may result in exhibiting controlling behavior later in life. The need for control that could lead to domestic violence may be linked to several individual factors, including:less access to education, personality disorders, substance use, cultural attitudes, gender ideologies, low self-esteem, struggling with anger management or insecurity. Usually, abusive behavior starts subtly and gradually and can become continuous over time. With domestic violence, these nuanced behaviors lead to physical, sexual, or psychological violence.Even when domestic abuse escalates, the more subtle behaviors like financial or emotional abuse may continue being used as a method of reinforcing violence by subduing the abused partner further, making them easier to control. If you notice your partner’s behaviors are increasingly focused on controlling or manipulating you, this could indicate that you may be in an escalating domestic violence situation.</p>

                        <p class="mb-0">My Name is Aisha, I am a domestic violence survivor. I was in a relationship that was really violent and ended with me being stabbed in the chest. My lung collapsed and I suffered from a ruptured diaphram. This was the lowest point of my life because I allowed the violence to escalate and I put my children in danger. I could have lost my life, but I realized that there is no one more important that my children and myself. Almost losing my life was a wake up call for me and my family. No one should let domestic violence get this far. Love does not hurt. You should never let someone bruise you physically or emotionally.</p>
